**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

[Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the Third code cell of the IPython notebook located in "advanlane.ipynb"

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imagepoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection. In most of the calibrating images there are 48 corners excluding the outer ones so therefore we are looking for (9X6) corners which will stored in imagepoints array.

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

Once I have calibrated the camera I can utilize the calibration matrix (mtx) and distortion coefficients (dst) generated by `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function to undistort other images. So for example the below image is one of the test image which was undistorted using the `cv2.undistort()` function and by feeding mtx and dst (described previously) to it :

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I have used the following Gradients :

Sobel X Gradient with threshold of (20, 100) and kernel = 21

Sobel Y Gradient with threshold of (20, 100) and kernel = 9

Sobel Magnitude Gradient with threshold of (100,190) and kernel = 9

Sobel Direction Gradient with threshold of (0.7,1.3) and kernel = 19

Combined Gradient Threshold using either X and Y Gradient together along with either Magnitude or direction Gradient

Also Following Color transforms were done using HLS image type :

Threshold of (100,255) was applies on the S channel of HLS image so that it could detect things with high saturation usually lane lines.

Threshold of (120,255) was applied on the light channel of HLS image so that edges due to shadows could be avoided.

Both of the Channels were then combined

Finally Gradient and Color Thresholds were combined using or condition and I was able to plot lane line clearly in most of the cases.

Below is an example of the thresholded image :

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `perp_transform()`, which appears cell no. 4 in the file `advanced_lane.ipynb` .  The `perp_transform()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`).  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points for perpective transform in the following manner :

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

After I have got the perspective transform then I used window search algorithm to identify lane line pixels and fit a polynomial of two degree to it the first time. The code is available in cell no. 5 represented  by function `fitpolyfirst()`. It takes the perspectively transformed images as a parameter and return the polynomials of two degree that fit left and right lane. Along with this the function also returns the radius of curvature.
For Video pipeline for the first frame `fitpolyfirst()` will be called after that once we have polynomial fit we dont need to do window search , we just have to search for lines based on the previous polynomial fit adjusting to margin of 100. For doing this we have another function `fitpoly()`.

Below is an output of the visualization of window search :

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I have calculated the radius of curvature in both `fitpolyfirst()` and `fitpoly()` and returned the curvatures along with the polynomial fit. For calculating Radius of curvature following code was written :

left_curverad = ((1 + (2*left_fit[0]*y_eval + left_fit[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*left_fit[0])

right_curverad = ((1 + (2*right_fit[0]*y_eval + right_fit[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*right_fit[0])

The above code implements the Formula for finding radius of curvature mentioned in the classroom.

I have Calculated the Vehicle center by taking a difference between the image center and the center of the two lane dtected. The code is available in the video pipeline function `process_image()`.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

After implementing the pipeline in cell no. 6 which was made specifically for testing the test images it was found that the lane lines were detected clearly. Below is an example of the image with lane line area marked :

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

The Code for pipeline implemented for video is available in cell no. 10 in function process_image() . It does all the thing required for identifying lane lines and finally returns a image with marked lane area.
Here's a [link to my video result](https://youtu.be/VPmTTSWx6Uo)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

The pipeline is likely to fail where the video is much more challenging like more shadows. We can fetch yellow lines while thresholding images for such case. This improvement was left for a future task for now.
